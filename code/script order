Order in which scripts should be run.

1. ABCD_Merge_3.0.
2. core_demographics_3.0.
3. ABCD_renamevariables. Note: Make sure that the later scripts are in fact using the correct alias names, otherwise this script might need to be moved later.
4. calculate_PDS. [Change to Herting et al. script?]
5. calculate_BISBAS_Reward.
6. add_PDS_categories. [Change to Herting et al. script?]
7. calculate_MRI_averages. (Note: the z scores that are created in this script would be compared to the whole sample rather than the half sample, however, so might want to do that part after dividing the data into the samples).
8. split data.

Exploratory sample
1. data cleaning and descriptives.

Confirmatory sample 
1. data cleaning and descriptives.
